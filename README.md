# ECE471Project
1. Structure of project  
  * Two main sub modules
     * VisualWords - Contains all of the functions to extract the feature vectors from the image
     * pLSA - Contains the PLSA class which will provide high level functions to run the classifier
     
validate_dataset - iterates over all images in the dataset and opens them to check if they are valid jpg files. Somehow files got corrupted on my computer.
